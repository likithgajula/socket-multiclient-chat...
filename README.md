# 🧠 Python Multi-Client Chat System with Server Discovery

This project is a **beginner-friendly Python socket programming chat system** that allows multiple clients to communicate over a network. It features a **discovery server** that dynamically shares the server’s IP and port, making it ideal for learning the fundamentals of networking, threading, and inter-device communication.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Server Discovery**: Clients don't need hardcoded IPs. A separate discovery server provides the current IP and port.
- 💬 **Multi-client chat**: Supports simultaneous messaging between multiple users.
- 🔐 **Private messaging**: Send direct messages using `@username`.
- 🧵 **Threaded client handling**: Ensures non-blocking communication on both client and server.
- 🖥️ **No external libraries** required — just pure Python!
